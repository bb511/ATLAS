Theory of this process goes in here.

## 2. Parameter Analysis

As a first criteria for the $Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ process, we are selecting events in which there are at least two leptons, **_one positive and one negative muon_**. On physical grounds, explained in [Section 1](#theory), only the highest [$p_T$](index.md#variable-names) was selected.
The parameters involved in the [invariant mass calculation](index.md#invariant-mass) of the muon pair have been plotted separately. They can be seen in the plot below.

From these, one can see that cuts on $\eta$ and $\phi$ would not be very lucrative. However, high $p_T$ signal muons dominate over all the other (simulated) sources in the [Muon data](index.md#data-sets-and-simulations).
