## 1.Theory
Theory of this process goes in here.

## 2. Parameter Analysis

As a first criteria for the $Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ process, we are selecting events in which there are at least two leptons, **_one positive and one negative muon_**. On physical grounds, explained in [Section 1](#theory), only the highest [pt](index.md#variable-names) was selected.
Below are presented plots of the parameters that go into Equation (1). These provide further arguments to employ the cuts we did.
