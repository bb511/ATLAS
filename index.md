## Introduction to the Experiment
---
$W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons are produced via proton-proton, $pp$, collisions by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hardron Collidor (LHC), Cern. The 2012 ATLAS run at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV, produced data which is made available for educational purposes by the [ATLAS Open Data project](https://cheatham1.gitbooks.io/openatlasdatatools/content/). This kind of experiment is fundamental in order to verify the electroweak interaction results predicted by the Standard Model. 

The production cross section of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ events are measured in this experiment. $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons are detected due to their decay into leptons ($e^{\pm}, \mu^{\pm}$) and neutrinos ($\nu$). These decays form characteristic experimental signatures which enable the measurement of physical parameters[[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0412146.pdf). The aim is to measure the overall production cross section $\sigma$ of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons. 


## Detector Overview

At the most basic level a particle detection element in a medium measures the local deposition of ionisation. This deposition generates electric fields in the medium which are picked up by electrodes. Consequently, an electrical signal is created and processed to be read out in a data stream.
The detection elements are arrayed such that one can distinguish a pattern of energy deposits, which can then be linked back to particles produced in the collision event. The signals and detectors are organized such that physicists can measure the energy and momentum of the various particles either by **reconstructed trajectory** or by **proportionality of the signal to energy**. Different particles that traverse the detector are distinguished by the type of interactions they have with the medium: strong, electromagnetic or weak. The latter are undetectable unless they **decay** (mainly into leptons). A schmatic of the ATLAS detector is shown in Figure 1.

Other than inner charged particle tracking detector, the other devices are outside the thin solenoid coil, which provides a 2 T field. Muon identification and measurement provided by additional very large toroidal magnet systems. All coils are made of superconducting material.
Calorimeter concept (relevant for detecting electrons or positrons and particle showers) is of novel design, using an accordion-like radiator structure. Good uniformity for sampling using ionization in Liquid Argon.

For this specific experiment, we are interested in the decay of the $Z^0$ and $W^\pm$ (massive particles) into leptons which we can detect and categorize. A muon/electron generated by the decay of these bosons must pass through what are called "levels" of the detector to get picked up as definite, usable data. The first-level trigger system uses a subset of the total detector information to make a decision on whether or not to record each event, reducing the data rate to about 75 kHz. Additionally, there are two subsequent levels also known as the high-level triggers which provide reduction to a final data-taking rate of approximately 200 Hz.

## General Concepts and Formulas
---
Here are presented some general concepts that are going to be used throughout the website. Whenever a results is stated, it will link back here to explain how we got that result.

### Invariant Mass

The invariant mass of the lepton pair in the $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$ and $Z\rightarrow ee$ processes is calculated using the formula
\begin{equation}
M = \sqrt{(E_++E_-)^2 - (p_{x+}+p_{x-})^2 - (p_{y+}+p_{y-})^2 - (p_{z+}+p_{z-})^2}
\end{equation}

where $E_+$ and $E_-$ are the energies of the positive and negative lepton respectively, $p_{x+}$ and $p_{x-}$ are their $x$ component of momentum, etc.. This cross section formula was obtained by using the four momenta of the two leptons that result from the $Z$ decay. For more information on the variable please consult [here](#variable-names).

### Transverse Mass

The transverse mass formula was given in the lab script. For completeness, it is
\begin{equation}
m_t = \sqrt{2E_T^{miss}p_T^l(1-\mathrm{cos}(\Delta\phi))}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta\phi = \phi^{miss}-\phi^{l}$ and $p_T^l$ and $\phi^l$ are the $\phi$ and $p_T$ of the lepton. For more information on the variables mean please consult [here](#variable-names).

Another source for the transverse mass formula can be found at this [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjc%2Fs10052-017-5475-4).

### Cross Sections

The cross section of a specific process (e.g. $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$) was calculated using the formula

\begin{equation}
	\sigma = \frac{N - B}{\epsilon \int Ldt}
\end{equation}

where $N$ number of selected events, $B$ is the number of background events, $\epsilon$ is the efficiency of selecting signal events and $\int Ldt$ is integrated luminosity which measures the number of $pp$ collisions resulting in collectable data.
