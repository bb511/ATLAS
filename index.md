## Introduction to the Experiment
---
$W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons are produced via proton-proton, $pp$, collisions by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hardron Collidor (LHC), Cern. The 2012 ATLAS run at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV, produced data which is made available for educational purposes by the [ATLAS Open Data project](https://cheatham1.gitbooks.io/openatlasdatatools/content/). This kind of experiment is fundamental in order to verify the electroweak interaction results predicted by the Standard Model. 

The production cross section of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ events are measured in this experiment. $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons are detected due to their decay into leptons ($e^{\pm}, \mu^{\pm}$) and neutrinos ($\nu$). These decays form characteristic experimental signatures which enable the measurement of physical parameters[[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0412146.pdf). The aim is to measure the overall production cross section $\sigma$ of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons. 


## Detector Overview

At the most basic level a particle detection element in a medium measures the local deposition of ionisation. This deposition generates electric fields in the medium which are picked up by electrodes. Consequently, an electrical signal is created and processed to be read out in a data stream.
The detection elements are arrayed such that one can distinguish a pattern of energy deposits, which can then be linked back to particles produced in the collision event. The signals and detectors are organized such that physicists can measure the energy and momentum of the various particles either by **reconstructed trajectory** or by **proportionality of the signal to energy**. Different particles that traverse the detector are distinguished by the type of interactions they have with the medium: strong, electromagnetic or weak. The latter are undetectable unless they **decay** (mainly into leptons). A schmatic of the ATLAS detector is shown in Figure 1.

Other than inner charged particle tracking detector, the other devices are outside the thin solenoid coil, which provides a 2 T field. Muon identification and measurement provided by additional very large toroidal magnet systems. All coils are made of superconducting material.
Calorimeter concept (relevant for detecting electrons or positrons and particle showers) is of novel design, using an accordion-like radiator structure. Good uniformity for sampling using ionization in Liquid Argon.

For this specific experiment, we are interested in the decay of the $Z^0$ and $W^\pm$ (massive particles) into leptons which we can detect and categorize. A muon/electron generated by the decay of these bosons must pass through what are called "levels" of the detector to get picked up as definite, usable data. The first-level trigger system uses a subset of the total detector information to make a decision on whether or not to record each event, reducing the data rate to about 75 kHz. Additionally, there are two subsequent levels also known as the high-level triggers which provide reduction to a final data-taking rate of approximately 200 Hz.

## General Concepts and Formulas
---
Here are presented some general concepts that are going to be used throughout the website. Whenever a results is stated, it will link back here to explain how we got that result.

### Invariant Mass

The invariant mass of the lepton pair in the $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$ and $Z\rightarrow ee$ processes is calculated using the formula
\begin{equation}
M = \sqrt{(E_++E_-)^2 - (p_{x+}+p_{x-})^2 - (p_{y+}+p_{y-})^2 - (p_{z+}+p_{z-})^2}
\end{equation}

where $E_+$ and $E_-$ are the energies of the positive and negative lepton respectively, $p_{x+}$ and $p_{x-}$ are their $x$ component of momentum, etc.. This cross section formula was obtained by using the four momenta of the two leptons that result from the $Z$ decay. For more information on the variable please consult [here](#variable-names).

### Transverse Mass

The transverse mass formula was derived by setting all the $z$ components to 0. Consequently, it is given by
\begin{equation}
m_t = \sqrt{2E_T^{miss}p_T^l(1-\mathrm{cos}(\Delta\phi))}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta\phi = \phi^{miss}-\phi^{l}$ and $p_T^l$ and $\phi^l$ are the $\phi$ and $p_T$ of the lepton. For more information on the variables mean please consult [here](#variable-names).

Another source where the transverse mass formula is used can be found at [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjc%2Fs10052-017-5475-4).

### Cross Sections

The cross section of a specific process (e.g. $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu$) was calculated using the formula

\begin{equation}
	\sigma = \frac{N - B}{\epsilon \int Ldt}
\end{equation}

where $N$ number of selected events, $B$ is the number of background events, $\epsilon$ is the efficiency of selecting signal events and $\int Ldt$ is integrated luminosity which measures the number of $pp$ collisions resulting in collectable data.

## Uncertainties
---
Here we detail all the sources of uncertainty considered in the experiment. These can be categorized into three types: statistical, systematic and due to the luminosity.

### Statistical Uncertainties

These were calculated by using straight forward error propagation from the cross section formula. The errors on $N$ and $B$ were estimated to be their square root as in
\begin{equation}
\delta N = \sqrt{N} \; \mathrm{and} \; \delta B = \sqrt{B}.
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the errors on the efficiency were estimated using the **binomial formula**
\begin{equation}
\delta \epsilon = \frac{\sqrt{k(1-k/N)}}{N}.
\end{equation}
Thus, from the error propagation formula, the error on the cross section is given by
\begin{equation}
\delta \sigma = \text{$\sigma $} \sqrt{\frac{\text{$\delta $B}^2+\text{$\delta $N}^2}{(\text{N}-\text{B})^2}+\left(\frac{\delta \epsilon }{\epsilon }\right)^2}
\end{equation}

Any other propagation of errors done in this experiment follows the same lines. Explicit calculation of the statistical errors are available in the Mathematica Notebooks.

### Systematic Uncertainties

Two methods were used in estimating the systematic uncertainty on the final cross section results. 

First, we varied the cuts on the cones to calculate multiple cross sections. An example is available [here](Zmumu.md#cone-cuts). The range of the obtained cross sections was taken to be a first estimate of the systematic uncertainty of that process.

Additionally, based on symmetry, we assumed that the cross section should be the same if calculated at closed intervals of $\eta$. The intervals 0-0.8, 0.8-1.6 and 1.6-2.4 were taken. The cone cut variation technique was applied on each of the intervals to calculate a range of cross sections. As mentioned previously, symmetry demands that these cross sections should be the same. For example, the cross section calculated for a 2 GeV cone cut in the $\eta$ range of 0-0.8 should be the same as a 2 GeV cut on the $\eta$ range from 0.8-1.6. Not suprisingly, there exists a difference between the "symmetric" values. This difference was taken to be our second estimate of the systematic uncertainty.

The value quoted on the final results section of each process is the qudrature sum of the systematic uncertainty obtained through the two different methods.

**Note:** In the case of electron decay products, the 0.8-1.6 range was not considered when calculating the second estimate of the systematic uncertainty. This is because a big gap in the electron number was observed between $\approx 1.3$ to $\approx 1.5$. A plot of this phenomenon is available [here](Zmumu.md#parameter-analysis) and [here](Wmunu.md#parameter-analysis)

### Luminosity Uncertainty

The luminosity uncertainty at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV is given to be 2%, as in the lab script.
